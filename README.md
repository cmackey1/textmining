## Summary
An underdraduate course in quantitive and computational approaches to analyzing large bodies of text. Broadly speaking, the course covers text mining, content analysis, and basic machine learning, emphasizing (but not limited to) approaches with demonstrated value in literary studies. Students will learn how to clean and process textual corpora, extract information from unstructured texts, identify relevant textual and extra-textual features, assess document similarity, cluster and classify authors and texts using a variety of machine-learning methods, visualize the outputs of statistical models, and incorporate quantitative evidence into literary and humanistic analysis.

Most of the methods treated in the class are relevant in other fields. Students from all majors are welcome. No prerequisites, but some programming experience strongly recommended. Taught in Python. Counts toward the Digital Humanities track of the Computing and Digital Technologies (CDT) minor and as a free elective in the Data Science minor.  

## Texts

### Required

Bengfort, Benjamin, Rebecca Bilbro, and Tony Ojeda.[ _Applied Text Analysis with Python_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052555.do). O'Reilly, 2018. See the book's [associated GitHub repo](https://github.com/foxbook/atap) for code samples and related data sets.

### Optional
